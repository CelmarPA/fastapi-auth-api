"""
Database model for storing detailed security-related events.

This table helps track authentication, authorization, and other critical
security operations. It is useful for:
- Auditing user activity
- Detecting suspicious or malicious behavior
- Troubleshooting authentication issues
- Monitoring system access patterns

Each record represents a single security event such as login attempts,
permission violations, token usage, or system actions.
